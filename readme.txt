== Description ==

WooCommerce's default sale bulk editing for product only enables user to edit 20 products (the number of products appear at the Dashboard > Products) at the same time. There's a circumstance where user want to edit more than that number of products at the same time. This plugin is developed to solve that need: Editing more number of products' sale data at the same time.
